8. `# End of script` (line)

For languages that let you title the program (such as Eiffel, FORTRAN, BASIC, and many others) the program name is usually written as `projectLanguageFile`, `languageFile`, or something else that is similar, as follows:

1. `// Start of script` (line)

2. Comment with the program output

3. Normal programming language headers and imports (`#include`, `int main()`, `etc`)

4. Program name (`appName = "projectLanguageFile"`)

5. An output statement with the same output as 1 (above)

6. Commented file info

7. `// End of script` (line)

The syntax is written differently depending on the programming language, but it always follows this order.

The comment for a project language file is usually related to a pun or something related to the name of the project, or what the project is mostly written in. Some examples being:

> The Tiny Tower image repo is written in **Eiffel**, as it is the only programming language I know based off a tower (like the **Eiffel** tower)

> My battery image repository is written in **Assembly**, as batteries typically require **assembly**.

> My mountain image repository is written in **C**, as I can **C** (see) the mountain from my house

> My AdVenture Capitalist image repository is written in **C++**, as **C++** has classes, capitalism also has economic classes. In reverse, my AdVenture Communist image repository is written in **C**, as **C** was originally a classless language, and Communism doesn't have economical classes.

However, sometimes I can't come up with a pun. Some exceptions have been made for this:

> Projects related to a farm or ranch are normally written in **Vala**.

> Projects that are for something I don't like too much are written in languages I don't like that much, such as **Go** (2009 language by Google)
